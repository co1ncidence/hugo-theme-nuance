## Features
This is meant to be an extremely minimal blog theme, with only what you really need for a blog and no extra bloat. There really isn't many special features, just clean and efficient CSS throughout. And the theme also uses the user's local fonts, so no unnecessary inclusion of Google API. There is also some nice animations on links with the ones on text, title, and nav elements all having their own unique effects. I've also made the code blocks and tables stand out a bit more as a nice touch

> Note: since everything is in monospace font, the width is in characters (80) instead of pixels, which means it can vary based on the user's set font.

I highly recommend, however, that you keep an agnostic font stack in the CSS of this theme, I have a good one set already but you can mess with it if you'd like.

## Installation
First, clone this repository into your `themes/` folder from the root of your Hugo site:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/co1ncidence/hugo-theme-nuance.git themes/hugo-theme-nuance
```
Once you've done that, copy over the example configuration file and modify to your needs:
```sh
cp themes/hugo-theme-nuance/exampleSite/config.toml .
```

## Adding Menus
Say you wanted to make a menu called "rices" that had it's own page, you would add this to `config.toml` under the other menus:
```toml
  [[menu.main]]
    name = "Rices"
    identifier = "rices"
    url = "/rices/"
    weight = 4
```
Then you would create a new folder for this page:
```sh
mkdir content/rices/
```
Finally, add the index page using Hugo:
```sh
hugo new rices/index.md
```
Now whatever you put in `index.md` will show in the page generated by your new menu link.
