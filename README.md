## Features

[Theme Demo, my own blog :P](https://co1ncidence.github.io)

This is meant to be an extremely minimal blog theme, with only what you really need for a blog and no extra bloat. There really isn't many special features, just clean and efficient CSS throughout. The theme uses the following fonts:
  - Fira Code, hosted [jsdeliver](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tonsky/FiraCode@3/distr/fira_code.css)
  - Inter, hosted on [the creator's website](https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css)

There is also some nice animations on links with the ones on text, title, and nav elements all having their own unique effects. I've also made the code blocks and tables stand out a bit more as a nice touch. Headers 2 and 3 have a corresponding number of dashes behind them code blocks are slightly wider than texts and have inset shadows and monokai light theme. There are also some other small things but I don't care to mention them here.

> Note: mobile support is a WIP

## Installation
First, clone this repository into your `themes/` folder from the root of your Hugo site:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/co1ncidence/hugo-theme-nuance.git themes/hugo-theme-nuance
```
Once you've done that, copy over the example configuration file and modify to your needs:
```sh
cp themes/hugo-theme-nuance/exampleSite/config.toml .
```

## Adding Menus
Say you wanted to make a menu called "rices" that had it's own page, you would add this to `config.toml` under the other menus:
```toml
  [[menu.main]]
    name = "Rices"
    identifier = "rices"
    url = "/rices/"
    weight = 4
```
Then you would create a new folder for this page:
```sh
mkdir content/rices/
```
Finally, add the index page using Hugo:
```sh
hugo new rices/index.md
```
Now whatever you put in `index.md` will show in the page generated by your new menu link.
